Tasks: 

-discuss workflow
-Question suggestion: 
How to organize the best campagne (on twitter)? 
State with the highest spread of Trump/Biden support?
Geolocalisze all tweets, general sentiment analyses average through the last two months -> assign label (in republican/non repuclican state) 

"Is there a difference in twitter sentiment behaviour in swing states compared to republican/democrate states?"(What are the features that differentiate them)


Bias& Problem: 
Tweets that are in the USA, but they have a 'NaN' label
Get rid of country & build our own variable 


Clean data: 

tweet_id
user_id
user_join_date
city
state 
country
statecode
collected_at


before joining sets: 
compute average sentiment for each state

new features: 

trump average sentiment (day/given state)
biden average sentiment (day/given state)

does it mention Trump/Biden?

English(Y/N)
Spanish(Y/N)
Other language(Y/N)


Cluster: 

group all tweets together in this dataframe on a state bases:
name,weighted sum (function we have to discover), abundance of engish speakers, abundance of spanish speakers, abundance of other, last election dominated by democrats/republicans, average sentiment on given date(last debate/the election day/on the proclamation day),urban/total ratio by inhabitants,


3 groups: 
democrats/swing/republican


Visualise with geopandas: colour each state 


To dos until next meeting (28.11.):
